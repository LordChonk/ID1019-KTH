# Taking Derivatives in Elixir

This assignment is primarily implementing a simple function in Elixir that will take the derivative of a mathematical function and present it in a simplified form. In the code, there is a test function which finds the drivative of f(x) = 2x^2. The function is called with Der.test0 in the interactive elixir environment.

The report discusses the task in much greater detail.
